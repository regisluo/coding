 * 952. Largest Component Size by Common Factor
 * Description: https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-component-size-by-common-factor/
 *
 * You are given an integer array of unique positive integers nums. Consider the following graph:
 *
 * There are nums.length nodes, labeled nums[0] to nums[nums.length - 1],
 * There is an undirected edge between nums[i] and nums[j] if nums[i] and nums[j] share a common factor greater than 1.
 * Return the size of the largest connected component in the graph.
